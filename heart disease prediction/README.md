### TITLE
HEART DISEASE DETECTION
### DOMAIN
HEALTH CARE
### OBJECTIVE
   To create an efficient Machine learning models to predict the patient has Heart disease or not with the given labelled data set

    

### DATA DESCRIPTION
##### age:   age in year

##### sex: Male=1 ,Female=0

##### cp: Chest pain experienced (1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic)

##### trestbps: resting blood pressure in (mmHg), Ideal blood pressure is considered to be between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg, High 140/90 mmHg or higher, Low 90/60 mmHg or Lower

##### chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dL the normal range in (All aged 19 and younger at most 170 mg/dL) and (in aged 20 and older 125-200 mg/dL)

##### fbs: the person's fasting blood suger (>120 mg/dL) (1=True, 0=False)

##### restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurmeant (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormal, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)

##### thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

##### exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

##### oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

##### slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment ( 1: upsloping, 2: flat, 3: downsloping)

##### ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

##### thal: Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form or ,
##### inadequate amount of hemoglobin. (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

##### target: Heart disease (1= True, 0= False)
