CUSTOMER SEGMENTATAION ANALYSIS


## DOMAIN
RETAIL
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
 Suppose the managerial team of an online retail shop approaches you, a data scientist, with the dataset wanting to know whether customers will make their next purchase 90 days from the day they made their last purchase. Your answer to their inquiry will help them identify which customers their marketing team need to have a focus on with regard to the next promotional offers they will be rolling out.build a machine learning model that predicts whether an online customer of a retail shop will make their next purchase 90 days from the day they made their last purchase.
