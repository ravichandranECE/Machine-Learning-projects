LUNG CANCER PREDICTION


## DOMAIN
HEALTH CARE
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
We intend to develop a comprehensive predictive model for lung cancer risk assesment using a dataset enriched with a wide array of patient attributes,including gender,age,smoking history,and a spectrum of health-related indicators
## DATA DESCRIPTION
 GENDER: The individual's gender, whether male or female (M/F)

 AGE: The person's age in years

 SMOKING: A binary indicator of smoking history (Yes=2/No=1)

 YELLOW FINGERS: Presence of yellowing of fingers (Yes=2/No=1)

 ANXIETY: Presence of anxiety issues (Yes=2/No=1)

 PEER_PRESSURE: Exposure to peer pressure (Yes=2/No=1)

 CHRONIC DISEASE: Presence of chronic diseases (Yes=2/No=1)

 FATIGUE: Presence of chronic tiredness or fatigue (Yes=2/No=1)

 ALLERGY: Presence of allergies (Yes=2/No=1)

 WHEEZING: Occurrence of wheezing (Yes=2/No=1)

 ALCOHOL: Alcohol consumption (Yes=2/No=1)

 COUGHING: Presence of chronic coughing (Yes=2/No=1)

 SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Experience of shortness of breath (Yes=2/No=1)

 SWALLOWING DIFFICULTY: Difficulty in swallowing (Yes=2/No=1)

 CHEST PAIN: Presence of chest pain (Yes=2/No=1)
 
 LUNG_CANCER: Has Lung Cancer or not (YES/NO)
